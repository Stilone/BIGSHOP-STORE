# BIGSHOP Store

Hello! 🚀 This project became my second, and perhaps the most significant. When I decided to leave my job and dedicate more time to programming, BIGSHOP became my bridge to JavaScript.

This online store was created using vanilla JavaScript.
To run the project, download and open the file:

``products-page.html``

Some key features of the project include:

- 🛒 Adding products to the cart
- 🗑️ Removing products from the cart
- 🔢 Managing the quantity of products
- 💲 Calculating the total cost of items in the cart
- 🎯 Filtering products on the page
- 💼 Using localStorage to save the cart when reloading the page
- 🛍️ Completing the purchase on a new page

Creating this project took me a month. It became a bridge to learning JavaScript, and every time I revisit the local-storage.js file, tears of memories come back.
